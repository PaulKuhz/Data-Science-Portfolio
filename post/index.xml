      <description>For a private project, I researched the state-of-the-art recommender systems (RecSys). These algorithms are designed to 
      suggest items to users based on factors such as similarity between users (User-based Collaborative Filtering), similarity between items 
      (Item-based Collaborative Filtering), the content of items, and user preferences (Content-Based Filtering), or a combination of these 
      methods (Hybrid Methods). In this article, I explore CountVectorization, the LightFM library, and the RelationalAI’s Snowflake Native 
      App. I apply Weighted Approximate-Rank Pairwise (WARP) loss function and Cosine Similarity to address real-world challenges and provide 
      their solutions.</description>

      <description>As a data science intern at Ekimetrics, I collaborated with three analysts from the company's London 
      office to conduct an in-depth analysis of the performance of a leading S&P 500 company in the UK fashion 
      industry. Our analysis focused on evaluating both short-term and long-term media return on investment, 
      assessing the brand halo impact of luxury campaigns across various channels, and measuring the media 
      memory impact on current transactions. We also reported the contributions of different media channels 
      by campaign type, such as lifestyle and commerce, and evaluated the impact of events, sponsorships, and 
      celebrity endorsements on both short-term and long-term business performance.</description>

      <title>Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM): Comparing Bayesian Modeling using PyMC3 vs. Random Forest Modeling with SHAP Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://paulkuhz.github.io/Data-Science-Portfolio/post/AdvancedMMM/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 4 Nov 2023 11:13:32 -0400</pubDate>

      <guid>https://paulkuhz.github.io/Data-Science-Portfolio/post/AdvancedMMM/</guid>
      <description>In this article, I explore two different advanced Marketing Mix
        Modeling (MMM) approaches and compare the results obtained from the Bayesian
        approach with those from the Random Forest approach. The Random Forest
        approach, which captures non-linear relationships and interactions more
        effectively, outperforms the Bayesian approach, showing significant
        improvements in performance metrics, with a 40% reduction in MAPE and
        a 17% decrease in NRMSE.</description>

      <description>For these projects, I managed 39.7 MB of healthcare data in SQL
        and visualized the results in three Tableau dashboards. In the first dashboard,
        I presented the annual flu vaccination rates in counties in Massachusetts
        for 2022. In the second, I displayed an emergency room visits dashboard
        based on fictional data. In the third, I showcased the geographical
        distribution of COVID-19 globally as of October 2023.</description>

      <description>This group project was conducted for the course on Income Inequality instructed by Professor Jonathan Vogel in the Master of Quantitative Economics program at UCLA. The corresponding presentation slide deck can be downloaded. We explored the question of how the share of people owning an Associate’s Degree and the wage differences compared to other degrees evolved after the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007/2008.
The underlying theory, supported by empirical research, suggests that as the unemployment rate increases, college enrollment rates also tend to rise (Long, 2004b).</description>

      <description>This group project was a contribution to the Data Science Union. We viewed it as an exploratory journey into the field of image creation with &amp;lsquo;Dalleshop,&amp;rsquo; a word combining &amp;lsquo;Dall-e&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Photoshop.&amp;rsquo; Our inspiration stemmed from the work of Omar Sanseviero and Santiago.
The basic idea of picture creation is simple: you first give a model some noise, in other words, millions and millions of pictures, to generate an image through a neural network.</description>
