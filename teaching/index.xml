      <description>In Summer 2023, I introduced several rotations of incoming UCLA students to Python
        with a focus on data analysis through a hands-on approach. Of over 120 students from 4 continents,
        I taught a 26-student cohort remotely in daily two-hour tutorials covering Numerical Programming,
        Data Manipulation, Plotting/Visualization, and Data Analysis. My supervisor for this program was
        Dr. Randall R. Rojas.</description>

      <description>TThis course is part of the Master's degree program in Quantitative Economics at UCLA. As a former
        student of this class during my second year, I conducted weekly one-hour tutorials for first-year students.
        The course integrates financial concepts, such as portfolio theory, with statistical concepts, such as advanced
        probability and Time Series Analysis. The course and the lectures were instructed by Prof. Zhipeng Liao.</description>
