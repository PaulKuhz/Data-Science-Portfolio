      <description>Employees often manually sort incoming emails into subfolders for better organization. My challenge 
      is to develop a machine learning model using a dataset of around 450,000 real emails and their manual subfolder assignments. The goal 
      is to identify key factors for sorting emails and automate the process, reducing manual effort. To tackle this, I will employ 
      Bag-of-Words, Bag-of-Words Bigram, and Tf-Idf (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) for text representation. The 
      classification algorithms I will use include Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB), Multinomial Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree, Support Vector 
      Machine (SVM), AdaBoost, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)</description>

      <title>CountVectorizer, LightFM, and RelationalAI’s Snowflake Native App: Recommender systems applying WARP and Cosine Similarity</title>

      <description>For a private project, I researched the state-of-the-art recommender systems (RecSys). These algorithms are 
        designed to suggest items to users based on factors such as similarity between users (User-based Collaborative 
        Filtering), similarity between items (Item-based Collaborative Filtering), the content of items, and user preferences 
        (Content-Based Filtering), or a combination of these methods (Hybrid Methods). In this article, I explore 
        CountVectorization, the LightFM library, and the RelationalAI’s Snowflake Native App. I apply Weighted Approximate-Rank 
        Pairwise (WARP) loss function and Cosine Similarity to address real-world challenges and provide their solutions.</description>

      <title>Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM): FY2024 Analysis of an S&P 500 Fashion Company</title>

      <description>As a data science intern at Ekimetrics, I collaborated with three analysts from the company's London 
        office to conduct an in-depth analysis of the performance of a leading S&P 500 company in the UK fashion 
        industry. Our analysis focused on evaluating both short-term and long-term media return on investment, 
        assessing the brand halo impact of luxury campaigns across various channels, and measuring the media 
        memory impact on current transactions. We also reported the contributions of different media channels 
        by campaign type, such as lifestyle and commerce, and evaluated the impact of events, sponsorships, and c
        elebrity endorsements on both short-term and long-term business performance. It is important to note 
        that, due to data privacy concerns, all figures in the analysis have been slightly modified.</description>

      <description>As a data science intern at Ekimetrics, I, along with four other analysts, conducted an in-depth 
        analysis of the performance of a leading S&P 500 company in the electrolyte drinks market in the US. 
        This study covered a three-year period up to September 30, 2023. Our comprehensive analysis focused 
        on comparing the latest 52-week period with the same period in 2022, offering valuable insights into 
        market dynamics and strategic outcomes. Due to data privacy concerns, all numbers presented in this 
        analysis have been slightly modified.</description>

      <description>In this project, I undertook a comprehensive analysis of a bicycle
        store's Return on Investment (ROI) across a range of advertising strategies.
        Spanning five years, the store employed a deliberate approach by leveraging
        seven distinct marketing channels, which included both branded and non-branded
        search, Facebook, print, out-of-home advertising (OOH), television (TV),
        and radio.</description>

      <description>This project marked my debut as a data science intern at Ekimetrics in New York. Our team of 
        three analysts meticulously examined the entire US operations of an S&P 500 cosmetics company. 
        We focused on the period from January 2023 to December 2023, analyzing data across three key 
        channels: Brand.com, Retailer.com, and Brick & Mortar (B&M). Throughout the project, we 
        processed a substantial 10.5 gigabytes of data. For confidentiality reasons, all figures have 
        been slightly altered.</description>

      <description>I developed these three applications to strengthen my skillset in web design
using HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and
JavaScript (JS). The clock displays the current Pacific Standard Time, while the
random password generator and the to-do list are integrated into the portfolio
using <i>CodePen</i>. I'm excited to showcase these projects as they represent my
commitment to creating practical and engaging web applications. Feel free to
explore and interact with them!</description>

      <description>This project served as my final thesis and capstone project for the Master of Quantitative Economics program at UCLA, submitted during the spring quarter of 2023. The project was under the supervision of Professor Jonathan Vogel. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in reading the entire paper, you can download my thesis here.
The project aimed to assess the impact of the rise in imported goods from the People&amp;rsquo;s Republic of China on the United States of America with a focus on their inherent gender pay gap.</description>

      <title>Data Visualisation: The Change in Value of the Associate’s Degree after the 2007/2008 Financial Crisis</title>

      <description>This group project was conducted for the course on Income Inequality instructed by Professor Jonathan Vogel in the Master of Quantitative Economics program at UCLA. The corresponding presentation slide deck can be downloaded. We explored the question of how the share of people owning an Associate’s Degree and the wage differences compared to other degrees evolved after the Great Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2007/2008.
The underlying theory, supported by empirical research, suggests that as the unemployment rate increases, college enrollment rates also tend to rise (Long, 2004b).</description>

      <title>Image and Video Generation using Stable Diffusion</title>

      <description>This group project was a contribution to the Data Science Union. We viewed it as an exploratory journey into the field of image creation with &amp;lsquo;Dalleshop,&amp;rsquo; a word combining &amp;lsquo;Dall-e&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Photoshop.&amp;rsquo; Our inspiration stemmed from the work of Omar Sanseviero and Santiago.
The basic idea of picture creation is simple: you first give a model some noise, in other words, millions and millions of pictures, to generate an image through a neural network.</description>

      <description>In this project, which I undertook as part of the UCLA Data Science Union, I focused on predicting the outcome of the final matches of the 2022/2023 season in the German Soccer League Bundesliga. During the data collection phase, I gathered information from the FBRef website, covering a total of 24 out of the 34 matches that had been played up to that point. The aim of the project was to leverage data analysis and predictive modeling to anticipate the results of the remaining matches in the season&amp;rsquo;s final stage.</description>

      <description>This project highlights my involvement in the &amp;ldquo;Twitch Twits&amp;rdquo; program for the Data Science Union student association at UCLA. The dataset was meticulously collected from the Twitch API. By utilizing the &amp;ldquo;rTwitchAPI&amp;rdquo; package in the R programming language, I conducted web scraping to gather data pertaining to one of the most frequently featured games on the Twitch streaming platform: Alien Isolation.
The dataset comprised 871 distinct streaming titles. Initially, I partitioned the data into separate train and test sets.</description>

      <description>I love Data since it enables me to produce objective answers to subjective questions. My fascination for this tool guided me on my journey from quitting medical school in Germany to graduating from one of the best data science programs in the world.
Along this challenging but exciting path, I first developed a qualitative understanding of the world&amp;rsquo;s issues by studying politics and economics as an undergrad and working as a journalist.</description>
