      <description>In collaboration with one of Germany's most renowned sports economists,
      Professor Dr. Bernd Frick, this study employs various regression models
      to examine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the transfer activities
      of football clubs in the English Premier League, Spanish Primera Divisi√≥n,
      German Bundesliga, Italian Serie A, and French Ligue 1 during the summer of 2020.</description>

      <title>COVID-19 Impact on the Bremen Port Location: Acceleration of Restructuring?</title>
      <link>https://paulkuhz.github.io/Data-Science-Portfolio/post/bremen/</link>

      <description>The article discusses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the port
        location in Bremen. As a result of the crisis, the port has been significantly
        affected by a decline in trade due to supply and subsequent demand shocks. The
        COVID-19 crisis acts as a magnifying glass on structural changes and shifts or
        alterations in value chains, potentially accelerating the transformation of the
        port economy.</description>

      <title>Combined transport in Europe: Scenario-based projections of emission saving potentials</title>
      <link>https://paulkuhz.github.io/Data-Science-Portfolio/post/combined/</link>

      <description>The paper explores combined transportation methods in Europe and their
        impact on regional trade's environmental costs. It suggests that while
        infrastructure improvements can help, the emissions reduction effect is
        relatively small compared to the overall transport sector emissions. To
        make a substantial impact on emissions, it recommends reducing emissions
        from specific transportation modes. The paper concludes by discussing the
        future of combined transportation.</description>

      <title>Image and Video Generation using Stable Diffusion</title>

      <description>This group project was a contribution to the Data Science Union. We viewed it as an exploratory journey into the field of image creation with &amp;lsquo;Dalleshop,&amp;rsquo; a word combining &amp;lsquo;Dall-e&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Photoshop.&amp;rsquo; Our inspiration stemmed from the work of Omar Sanseviero and Santiago.
The basic idea of picture creation is simple: you first give a model some noise, in other words, millions and millions of pictures, to generate an image through a neural network.</description>

      <title>Random Forest in Machine Learning: Predict Match Winners in the German Soccer League Bundesliga</title>
      <link>https://paulkuhz.github.io/Data-Science-Portfolio/post/bundesligaprediction/</link>

      <description>In this project, which I undertook as part of the UCLA Data Science Union, I focused on predicting the outcome of the final matches of the 2022/2023 season in the German Soccer League Bundesliga. During the data collection phase, I gathered information from the FBRef website, covering a total of 24 out of the 34 matches that had been played up to that point. The aim of the project was to leverage data analysis and predictive modeling to anticipate the results of the remaining matches in the season&amp;rsquo;s final stage.</description>

      <description>This project highlights my involvement in the &amp;ldquo;Twitch Twits&amp;rdquo; program for the Data Science Union student association at UCLA. The dataset was meticulously collected from the Twitch API. By utilizing the &amp;ldquo;rTwitchAPI&amp;rdquo; package in the R programming language, I conducted web scraping to gather data pertaining to one of the most frequently featured games on the Twitch streaming platform: Alien Isolation.
The dataset comprised 871 distinct streaming titles. Initially, I partitioned the data into separate train and test sets.</description>
